# Instructions for Project Proposal

Each team will give a 10-15 minute presentation, detailing their project's planned work.

At the end of your presentation, we should all understand the goals of your projects as well as the means you plan to use to achieve them.

### Deliverables: 

    PDF/PPTX of the slides
    PDF of the presentation script

The presentation order of groups will be determined randomly.
**Note:** each student in the team has to speak during the presentation.

### Slides Guideline

Aim to spend in between 30s and 1min per slide of content.

    - Project Title in large. Your name, the course name/number for context, the date (smaller).
    - Introduction / Example
       - Give us an example of what your app will look like or how it will be used with a user story.
       - Grab our attention and make us interested in your app
    - Product Definition
       - Vision, target audience, problem, strategy and goals
       - Each word you add to a product definition is a point you are trying to make about your project.
       - What is your app's unique value proposition?
    - For each point in your product definition, spend 1-2 slides detailing it.
       - example: "our strategy is a mobile application. We want it to be mobile because our users will often be outside, where phones are more accessible than laptops or desktops. We want it to be an application as opposed to a mobile-friendly website because we need access to the local storage, camera, and location information, which our research shows is more complicated to access from a browser. After researching our options and consulting with the strengths of the team members, we've decided to use the React Native as it lets use develop for both iOS and Android."
       - Try to illustrate your points with pictures as much as with words.
       - example: to illustrate 'user-friendly' use mock-UIs (mock-UIs in general are useful and strongly recommended for the proposal)
       - Each point of the product definition is important, but pay particular attention to explaining your goals. Having well defined goals provides accountability for the team.
    - A few slides describing what technologies and platforms you plan to use.
       - Web, mobile, or something else
       - Front end UI
       - Back end, database infrastructure
       - Data source/API
    - A few slides with the description of work distribution.
       - What are the strengths of each student in the team?
       - What aspect of the project will each student be responsible for? 
    - A few slides on your project plan and timeline
       - What are the features you are targeting for the MVP?
       - What are the nice-to-have features that you plan to include after the MVP?

**Note:** All the work you do for the slides should be useful preliminary research work for your project. Your mentality should be: you are planning out the project first, and presenting the plan to us second.

### Product Thinking - Defining your project

The goal is to focus on shaping the thought process in defining a product keeping in mind the user, the experience, and how to come up with realistic achievable goals and features in order to achieve them.

The following layout helps define your project (adapt as you see fit):

> In order to ______ (vision)
> 
> our product will solve ______ (target audience)
> 
> problem of ______ (user problem)
> 
> by giving them ______ (strategy).
> 
> We know if our product works when we see ______ (goals).

**Example:** In order to *improve the life of New Yorkers* (vision), our product will *solve frequent commuters'* (target audience) problem of *wasting time/being late because of not knowing when the next bus arrives* (user problem) by giving them a *responsive mobile application that displays live bus arrival times nearby* (strategy). We know if our products work when we see: *a new user successfully navigates our UI, and growing numbers of satisfied users* (goals).

### Tips for Strong Presentations

Please practice your presentations. You should not stand up and give them cold.

Look at your slides on a zoom screenshare. The color and quality of your computer screen is way better than what the screenshare can reproduce.

### Presentation Script Guidelines

For each slide, you should write in full sentences what you plan on saying, and who will be saying it.

Having a script for public presentations serves multiple purposes:

    - Horces you to think about what exactly you will be saying. In turn this provides self-feedback and practice of sorts, making for better presentations.
    - Helps you during the presentation. If you lose track of what you wanted to say, you can just check the script.
