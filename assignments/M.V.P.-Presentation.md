# Instructions for Minimum Viable Product Presentation

Each team will give a 10-15 minute presentation, detailing their progress made and the product's current state.

At the end of your presentation, we should all understand the existing functionality of your product as well as the functionality which has yet to be implemented.

**Note:** The presentation should include a live demo of your product's functionality.

**Note:** The presentation order of groups will be determined randomly.

**Note:** Each student in the team has to speak during the presentation.

**Note:** Ensure that the code used in your demo has been pushed to GitHub.


### Format

  - 1-2 minutes to get set up
  - 10-15 minutes presentation
  - 3-5 minutes of questions


### Deliverables

  - PDF/PPTX of the slides
  - PDF of the presentation script


### Instructions

  - Walk us through how users would use your project.
  - Tell us a story from a user's perspective


### Goals of the demo

  - Convince the audience that your project achieves its stated MVP goals. 
  - Become comfortable giving presentations on your work


### Slides Guideline

You are encouraged to use slide for the beginning and end of your MVP presentation.
In fact, incorporate slides wherever you feel they enhance the presentation.
However, the main focus of your presentation should be a live demonstration of your product.
A short slide deck will likely be sufficient.
Consider the following example slide deck.

**Slide 0**
> Product Name, Team Members, Date, and Context.

**Slide 1**
> Keep this page blank except for the words "Demo".
> Stay on the demo while demonstrating your product.

**Slide 2**
> Bullet points of your claims (Product Definition), with simple visuals if possible.

**Slide 3**
> Remaining work.
> Because this is a mid-semester demo, you won't have finished everything.
> Define the next steps in your project, in order to fulfill the goals of your product definition, and present them.
> **Include a bulleted list of functionality for your final product presentation.**

**Slide 4 and beyond** *(all optional)*
> Tool/technologies/sources used.
> Which team member contributed to what.
> Ideas for future development (reach goals for final product).
> Technical details you predict you will be asked questions about (1-page per).
> Anything else which provides insight or context for your product.

**Slide (n - 1)**
> Summarize your presentation, thank your audience, and ask for any questions from the audience. 
> **Include a link to your** GitHub repository

Be sure to reference the [Product Description Slide Guideline][slides] for guidance on slide format.

### Demo Flow - Guided User Experience(s)

The goal is to demonstrate the functionality of your product.
Focus on walking through the different user experiences your product offers.
As you do so, showcase the existing functionality while commenting on the techniques you used to implement them and also note where future functionality will be in the final user experience.


### Tips for Strong Presentations

Please practice your presentations. You should not stand up and give them cold.

Look at your slides on a zoom screenshare. The color and quality of your computer screen is way better than what the screenshare can reproduce.


### Presentation Script Guidelines

For each slide, you should write in full sentences what you plan on saying, and who will be saying it.

Having a script for public presentations serves multiple purposes:

    - Forces you to think about what exactly you will be saying. In turn this provides self-feedback and practice of sorts, making for better presentations.
    - Helps you during the presentation. If you lose track of what you wanted to say, you can just check the script.
